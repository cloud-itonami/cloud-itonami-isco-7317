  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 7317 handicraft-workshop scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a workshop
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot performs crew scheduling,
  task/materials-usage/progress-record logging and wood/basketry-materials
  supply-order coordination for a wood-and-basketry handicraft workshop
  under this advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches hardware
  itself, never performs the craft fabrication work itself, and never
  finalizes a craft-fabrication-execution decision (e.g. a specific
  carving, weaving or finishing step) or overrides a workshop safety
  officer's judgment — those remain the workshop safety officer's
  exclusive judgment). Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7111's
  housebuilder.store (and closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9311's
  mininglabor.store for the physical-safety-domain shape).

  Domain:

    worker   — a registered handicraft-workshop crew member
               (:worker-id, :name)
    workshop — a registered wood/basketry handicraft workshop
               {:workshop-id :name :max-supply-cost number}.
               `:max-supply-cost` is an informational registered
               ceiling used only to decide whether a
               `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates to human
               sign-off (the governor never blocks a within-threshold
               order outright; it only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record   — a committed operating record (a logged
               task/materials-usage/progress entry, a scheduled crew
               operation, a flagged safety concern, or a coordinated
               supply order) — written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger   — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
